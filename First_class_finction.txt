Functions are First-Class Functions
In JavaScript, functions are first-class functions. 
This means that you can do with a function just about anything 
that you can do with other elements, such as numbers, strings, objects, 
arrays, etc. JavaScript functions can:

Be stored in variables
Be returned from a function.
Be passed as arguments into another function.
Note that while we can, say, treat a function as an object,
a key difference between a function and an object is that functions 
can be called (i.e., invoked with ()), while regular objects cannot.
